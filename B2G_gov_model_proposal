B2G OS governance model proposal

Goal:
As the code transition period will be over soon, the Mozilla staff will be less involved, the volunteer community needs to be more independent and to lead the governance process moving forward.

What?
The B2G OS community being still small -for now- the idea is to have a "provisional council" to work on the governance model of the B2G OS community.
Tasks to be managed:
    

    Manifesto finalization

    Relationship with Mozilla and potentially other organizations 

    PR/Official communication

    Is the B2G OS community representing Mozilla?

    Ask the PR team

    Code of conduct creation

    See Mozilla's https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/


Work on an organization model for governance. It will have to answer (at least):

    how is the decision making process shaped?

    absolute majority vote of the members

    who has a voice in it?

    The members, membership is volunteer based. 


Who?
Ideally, one person involved in each working group, and all people interested in building the governance model

Proposed members:
+ Ask on dev-fxos

How?
Identifying the governance questions, discussing it in regular meetings and help the group moving forward while building and documenting the governance structure.
The provisional council would have 6 months to work on the governance structure, before presenting his work, and re-evaluating the organization.


Merge the wg meetings in the weekly meeting
3 meetings : one every two months, the final one being at the end of the provisional council lifetime
ML for the council
