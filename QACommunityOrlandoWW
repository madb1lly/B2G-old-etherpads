Notes:
  

      Strategic ways we can improve the Foxfooding program

    [asa] Posting information to Discourse - post changelogs that show what is new in the Daily Build. Summary of the most important new things at the end or beginning or end of the week .

    Test plan - suggestions of how to test a particular area

    Things are most exciting when things land

    More communication about when changes are happening

    [ioana] Apply what we learned from Firefox for Android - build up wiki pages (public pages) with testplans, tests and results/status

    Need people to reply to the posts +1

    Using QA contact field

    [wquiver] - Communication channels

    Could we get a new maintainer for the Foxfooding app

    [pallavi] Smoketest results

    [jamie] - Daily bulettin (https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G/QA/Daily_Bulletin)

    [Marcia] - announcing the changes will make it easier for self starters

    we need to make it accesible for those who need handholding

    [Ioana] Use the QA Contact from bugzilla form and having a meta bugs 

    [asa] Some forums have badges - interesting to have a Foxfooding forum on discourse to answer questions - tell people when it should be moved to Bugzilla

    Recognition for being - rotate the role

    Each forum should have several Champions

    Does Discourse have this functionality?

    Triage Champions - needed for success

    We need to be there to be supportive

    TEACHING BY DOING

    Inviting more people to Triage sessions

    Use AirMo to record sessions [ioana]

    Whole day of timezones - set a day for a speciific task Triage/Verification etc and keep it so people get used to it and join 

    Events

    Connecting with Reps at planned events

    Teach people how to teach - Asa will develop a session in regard to this

    Intro Days [asa]

    Full day of world coverage and we will help you get started with the very basics

    Get prepared to do the work

    Moderators needed

    http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/#!/progornoprog/teach

    [Ioana] Ask Core people to share the wokr they do as example so others can start too ( ex. Manel on Automation) 

    Ask me anything session - once per month 


    Ports

    What can be do strategically to help the Porting program?

    Test and File bugs

    Stand up -  https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/b2g-qa-roundtable for status 

    bugs vs feedback

    we need to figure it out a clear process 

    many of the bugs are of all the types  - 

    new sections on discourse - bugs, feature requests. 

    foxfooding or nightly with sending info?

    check with domenik 

    QA should use Nightly as recommended

    check foxfooding app - webdevs Nikos 

    changelogs - needed  

    we can generate them from the hg

    Asa already doing it . 

    Mentors and dedicated persons

    Tuesday - do the triage afetr and comment in to the bugs - thanks for file the 


    [Marcela] I am interested to work on  triage (if someone can teach me how to do it) and also monitor discourse besides usual bug reporting, foxfooding qa.

    One and Done Hackathon

    Goals - 

    Clean up all the FxOS One and Done tasks?

    Get owners, update cases so they map to 2.6

    Get rid of out of date test cases

    Design a workflow that makes sense for One and Done to promote involvement beyond finishing the tasks

    Contributor pathways - what do they do after One and Done

    Set up a consistent way to write the tasks - maybe a template? [isabel]

    Same Format
