  == PHASE TWO ==

APIs we have already removed from mozilla-central:

    Bug 1261022 - Apps API (in progress)

    Bug 1261001 - Web Activities API

    Bug 1261011 - Inter-app Communication API

    Bug 1261009 - Data Store API

    Bug 1261013 - System Messages API

    Bug 1252570 - mozPay API

    Bug 1254287 - Engineering Mode API

    Bug 1270158 - KillSwitch API

    Bug 1269303 - RequestSync API

    Bug 1252573 - Mobile ID API

    Bug 1296579 - Simple Push API

    Bug 1300884 - Alarm API


APIs we should plan to remove from mozilla-central and find alternatives outside of Gecko:

    bluetooth  (unless Web Bluetooth moves forward?) - Security Team has serious concerns about the Web Bluetooth standard being developed at the W3C; assume safe to remove. 

    cellbroadcast

    devicestorage (replace with a file system web service)

    fmradio

    icc

    identity

    mobileconnection

    mobilemessage

    nfc

    phonenumberutils

    resourcestats

    settings (replace with a system settings web service)

    speakermanager

    telephony

    tethering

    tv

    voicemail

    wappush

    wifi (replace with system web service, have a working prototype)


Components needed to render web content and browser chrome and therefore we believe should remain in mozilla-central:

    Browser API (chrome-only, which Firefox is also using)

    Input Method API (chrome-only, to make the keyboard work)

    Camera Control API (chrome-only, unless we can replace it with WebRTC Streams)

    Gonk widget layer and A/V playback (We feel strongly about this part, it allows us to render web content directly onto the lower levels of Android without the Java Android runtime and all the technical redundancy and legal baggage that comes with that. This is hugely valuable.)


There are also Gonk back ends for APIs like the W3C Vibration API, W3C Battery API and W3C Wake Lock API which we could potentially move out of tree and we can be flexible on what to do with Nuwa.


== PHASE ONE (COMPLETE) ==

https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G/Transition_Project

Minimum required experience after transition:

    As a user I want to turn on the device and see the homescreen so I can launch websites

    As a user I want to configure WiFi so I can connect to the Internet

    As a user I want to set the correct time on my device so I can use it to tell the time(alarm?)

    As a user I want to navigate to a web page

    As a user I want to search the web

    As a user I want to enter text with the keyboard

    As a user I want to add sites to the homescreen

    As a user I want to make a phone call by dialing a number into the dialer (entry/exit call's log?)



Estimation scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
(1 is a one line change, 13 is a full two week sprint of work)

    Address book?

    Calendar?

    sync? (carddav?/caldav?)

    wallpaper?

    SMS

faramarz:20:06 could we have the dialer capability to this as well

faramarz:20:07 as a minimum, the phone should be able to place a phone call. contacts and stuff like that probably not as important, but dialer i feel like is a must.

benfrancis:17:41 The dialer wasn't mentioned in the original transition plan, but I've added it to this list and we'll see what we can do. I know Gabriele started looking into this.

Thatoo:20:41 good job :=)

kskarthik:07:59 thanks for working on the dialer :)

Lapineige:11:30 Hi all, is it a technical reference for Mozilla devs, or can we add points here ?

Lapineige:11:31 For instance (as Thatoo add), SMS are missing. And well, a phone with no sms support is... not really useful :(

sbneelu:08:45 I think the sleep mode and wallpaper should be part of the minumum required experience, not a stretch goal...

sbneelu:08:46 Also, I'm quite new to this. Is it completely open-source, as in, can I help to work on it?

Lapineige:18:02 yes ;)

Lapineige:18:02 (and your welcome)
