**** working more on FitBit API; got the FitBit working with OAuth2 with a python wrapper so I don't need to worry about verification code.  Took a little bit of time to figure out how to work past that until I did more digging around to seeing what's available (FitBit doesn't allow for Mechanize or other bots to access their APIs); waiting for the bulb

* What did I do today?

** Foxbox
*** Continue on setting up the unit test framework on Foxapp. Thanks to gmarty's feedback I avoided the mock browser problem by changing the test runner to Karma. It's a test runner that execute test within browsers. I'm getting some issues in regards to pipelining ES-2015 and the test runner
*** Tired to export code coverage in another repo than fxbox/foxbox https://github.com/fxbox/thinkerbell/pull/42. I got some issues with the workaround I used in my script. This workaround won't be necessary anymore in the next rust nightly. Then I'll wait until I'm back to continue on it.
*** Reviewed https://github.com/fxbox/app/pull/22. Reviewing https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/235/ . Still have https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/220 left before leaving
*** Helped in regards to tests failures/questions I've been asked on IRC.
*** Meeting with Isabel and No-Jun

** Vaani: Looked at config failures on the build for openhab-distro. It seems descriptor.json is not valid from a JSON point of view. I left details at  https://github.com/mozilla/openhab-distro/pull/1

* No blockers so far

* What will I do when I'm back?
** Catch up.
** Couldn't do it today, document assertion methods
** Continue on unit tests on FoxApp
** Turn on code coverage on another repo than foxbox

* What do I have in my queue?
** Continue to use rust as a lib

No-Jun

This Week
* TRIBE
Today
* Set up BinTray and TravisCI with separate email account and password
* Need to understand how to "share" Travis among people (because it is through my Repo) => Just put .travis.yml in other repos, and people will have to toggle a switch it on Travis' UI https://travis-ci.org/profile/$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME . However, I'd just recommend to toggle it on your account (for testing) and the mozilla one. You'll need an owner of the GH mozilla group to toggle the switch on that account. 
* Find out more details about Vaani prototype and start thinking about how to test

No-Jun

** FoxLink, unit tests: 
*** Code coverage ready for review https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/134
*** Office hour with Isabel and No-Jun + presentation 
*** Started to test Thinkerbell. I realized #[should_panic(expected = "foo")] is super strict with the error message given and doesn't handle .unwrap() well. I looked at rustc to see if we could upgrade the behavior. It seems doable in a reasonable amount of time.

Johan
* What did I do today?
** FoxLink, unit tests: 
*** for registar: Rebased  https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/103
*** Helped :cr and Isabel in regards to tests failures
*** Started to Investigate why unit tests take 30s each time I run `cargo test` with a single change in a test. At first, stainless macros don't seem to be the root cause. The tests themselves aren't either. If I have one single regular #[test], it still takes ±28s to compile/run. I'm taking unit tests out of the production code to see if that helps.

Yesterday
* Monday Meetings

    * Internal

    * Project

* Started looking more into Test Rail

    * Through John's efforts we've got a batch of test accounts for Test Rail, if you'd like to play around with it contact Stuart Philp


Today:
* Weekly Gaia meeting
* Play around with Test Rail
* Start looking into Squash TM / Testlink / Tarantula as those are other alternatives if we don't like Test Rail

Blocked?
Nope

No-Jun (read only, connected devices program update)
* What did I do today?

    created a mocha script(https://github.com/npark-mozilla/foxlinker/blob/master/test/philipshub_sync.js) that mimicks the philips bridge, and also sends a rest api command to foxbox to turn on light and have the fake bridge respond  to foxbox request

    this script shows that current integration approach is technically feasible and straightforward

* What will I do?

    Clean this script up with proper style, based on suggestions by jlorenzo

    Re-enabled those tests and put them on tryserver Bug 553417 -       Write new test for bug 299673

    Linux, Windows and e10s are failing, asking for feedback from :mats

    Bug 1251905 -       Convert test_continuous_wheel_events.html to use pushPrefEnv, this one already gives me failures locally, testing on try if it works fine there

    Tryserver gives errors, will need to have a linux environment to be able to test this (Docker image?) See example from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1251837

    Patch for Bug 1252135 -  Convert some tests in dom/events to use pushPrefEnv

    Bug 1252135 -       Convert some tests in dom/events to use pushPrefEnv 

    Checked in

    Patch r+ for bug 1252444 -  Rewrite some dom mochitests to use pushPrefEnv instead of setCharPref 

    Working on bug 1252369   -  Convert chrome mochitest test_selection_underline.html to use pushPrefEnv 

    Initial patch gives failures, so needs a better patch


Todo:

        Get a linux docker image working

*** Taskcluster: Made a patch. Got reviewed. Landed in b2g-inbound. Bug 1250178 - [e2e-py] Delete the tasks

* Am I blocked?

* What did I do today?
** Foxlink: Finished first revision of https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/54 . 
*** Bug noticed in the test https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/732 . I made a PR to update their documentation.
*** Meeting with Isabel and No-Jun https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/foxlink-automation
*** Julien discussed with me about mock. The API I proposed in the gist is not super clear. I'll update it.

* Started to document Jenkins and Taskcluster work. I broke down the document into 3 parts: The initial jenkins infrastructure, the one with bitbar included and TaskCluster. The first 2 ones are almost done. I'll continue to work on the 3rd part (which will be more detailed than the 2 first ones, because less things are standard). https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/304cyol5us (temporary etherpad -- will be uploaded to the wiki once finished)

* Am I blocked?

* What will I do on Monday?

Johan

* What did I do today?
** Foxlink
*** Managed to get some unit testing in http_server.rs https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/48 . I actually broken down the class so it's easier to test. There was a notable difficulty in these tests: pass a stub encapsulated in a container (like Container<Stub>). The solution is not very appealing but works. I asked Fabrice for review. 
*** Updated foxbox dependencies https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/49 . The build got broken on Friday because of a non backward-compatible update in rustc. We froze the version of the compiler on Friday, today was time to bring back the nightly
*** Started to play with file reading and file replacements for mocking purpose.

* What did I do today?
* meetings: automation rountable + 2 foxlink meetings. 

** Foxlink
*** https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/30  took me a significant amount of time today #RampingUpRust. I didn't get r+ from Fabrice. Tried macros to perform the setup of the tests. I lost much time trying to understand an error coming from the compiler  https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/30#discussion_r52456083  . I reduced the case to a small program, asked around in #rust, but didn't get any answer. In the end, after reading more carefully an email from Brian Anderson, there is a library that solved my issue https://github.com/reem/stainless . I changed my patch to use this test descriptor.
*** Read and commented product requirement document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OQd_-hbJNFSVBeaBcXQn4f1BlWpVpo5uBgNt5OT3Uds/edit#heading=h.8ve6cdffgjik

Johan (in the train, flaky connection, I can't even type in the etherpad without being disconnected)

* What did I do today?
** FoxLink:
*** Reviewed https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/pull/17 again
*** Documented on how to implement mocks in Rust https://www.gulshansingh.com/posts/how-to-write-a-rust-syntax-extension/ + rust obscure (aka unstable) documentation
**** This will require some heavy changes in the Rust compiler. 2 ways of doing it: Either enabling the feature in the rust main core, or creating a syntax_plugin. The second method seems more lightweight. In both cases, we'll have to deal with the AST (Abstract syntax tree) of the compiler to find what type needs to be mocked and change their code to return dummy values. 
**** I'm not very familiar with ASTs in general, and Rust too. This objective will likely take a notable amount of time. I discussed with Fabrice, we agreed on keep trying to make it work, but also use some of my time to write each stubs `a la mano` for each component of the project. This is gonna be hard to maintain in the long term, but at the beginning, this is better than having no test, or the habit of writting no test.

* On monday:
** Foxlink. Will implement the first stubs by hand. If I have time, try to implement a rust syntax addon for mocking purpose
** Deactivate the Jenkins (and taskcluster) jobs running against b2g-inbound
** Read more carefully Naoki's presentation

** Hacker Rank: Graded some questions for 2 new candidates.

** FoxLink:
*** Discussed with NoJun about splitting the test responsability. We probably go with NoJun on integration testing, and I'll be on unit tests (creating the framework, and adding tests where there are missing). End-to-end automation will be done once we have a full working prototype.

*** Made a PR for adding the first (ugly) unit test https://github.com/fabricedesre/foxbox/pull/1. Turned on code coverage. Found with Fabrice that the code coverage is not accurate (if functions are not used, they're not counted in the coverage percentage). Investigated with pnkfelix. It turns out the rust compiler strips unused functions from builds used for unit tests. I hacked into rust compiling tool chain, and got a correct report. Now I'm polishing up my patch to create a PR against rust compiler. I'll probably need to add a unit test, which can take more time to get used to.

* Tomorrow:
** Foxlink: code coverage, get a PR

*** Attended presentations about:
**** taking e2e testing out of VM for network/disk tools (they do it by wrapping C calls)
**** a tool that helps finding perf bottlenecks in microservices.
**** rasperry pies clusters management (for traditional web hosting, for instance)
**** provisionning VMs thanks to descriptive documents (à la Dockerfile)
** Hacker Rank: Graded 2 new candidates.

* Monday
** FoxLink meet up:
*** Looked into Fabrice's first prototype: https://github.com/fabricedesre/foxbox/

* [WIP] : bug 1224774 : follow up of nexus 5 : so I got the balrog to point to the public /fullimg, taskcluster itself is not pointed to make these parts public even though the task is asking it to be public.  I'm not sure where it's failing yet.
** next attempt : https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-inspector/#FIpjgn8TRdiWzrSb_g3KOQ/
** so I figured it out.  it doesn't matter if you put public/private for the b2g-phone-ota because the post-build.sh script is hard coded in pushing to certain directory.  There's no point in trying to clean that up right now, doing the quick patch.
** https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-inspector/#ZtychWc6RO2vy4Eipf2Psg/

* [Blocked by 1217130] bug 1241624 ; blocked.  Releng already has a image, it's not worth it for me to duplicate the efforts already done.  Once the image is there, we can utilize that image and push to balrog easier.

* What did I do today?

** FOSDEM presentation: 
** Got reverted. I broke a unit test without noticing. I repaired it, wait for the results to come and landed.  Bug 1232680 - Repair and reactivate call_log_test.js
** Got NI'd on bug 1242665 by KTucker. Set up debug env on Fennec to investigated DOM. Then, Vivien helped me in finding the culprit class in Gecko.
** FoxLink: Prepared my environment for the workweek.
*** Got Raspberry to connect to. Had to reconfigure my dns resolver (avahi wasn't used as a source) to ping the machine.
** Played with rust. Wanted to quickly set up unit test, coverage, to see how it's feasible. Struggled in concatening 2 strings. Finally set up a playground repo with CI running  https://github.com/JohanLorenzo/rust-testing-example

NOTE: monitoring bug 1240347 ; bug 1235392 ( need to flash eng.worker.20151130.124658 with newer gecko/gaia)
* look into hooks for timed builds for FOTA/mars

1/27:
* meetings : qa auto, qa standup, Jocelyn Goldfein, b2g-OTA in tree mentorship
* [WIP] : QA 101 : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wNc_XBfFnUa6JWiF6qnKg5AgFW1coFoZtM5nAR9HdA0/edit#slide=id.g106f2be277_0_0
** more progress
* bug 1224774 : following up with nexus 5, things are private still.  need to fix that.
** didn't seem to push to balrog either.  Not sure why?  Need to investigate log.  Goes with bug 1241624.  I think I probably should try fixing that first?
** actually I was wrong when looking through the logs.  It did report to balrog: https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/releases#B2G-gecko-dev-nightly-20160127015706  I looked at mozilla-central release not gecko-dev release.  just need to make things public instead of private.
** blocked: github down.
* [WIP] : bug 1241624 : https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/b2g-intree-mentorship need to change to balrog upload using similar model as upload symbols.
** blocked : need newer version of docker tools but can't reach server for download;

marcia:22:42 I think for intern candidates we should probably refrain from adding names to this etherpad since it is public
