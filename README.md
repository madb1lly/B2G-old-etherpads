# B2G-old-etherpads
Collection of text salvaged from old etherpads related to B2GOS, since Mozilla's EtherPad instance is now end of life. Some of this information may already be duplicated elsewhere like in the Mozilla wiki or MDN, but I don't know for sure.

The root domain of all pads is https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ since that's the only instance I can currently find active.
