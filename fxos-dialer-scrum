* Administrative:
** Nothing to report.
* Bug 977056 - [Dialer] Visual discrepancies: Call ended view under conference call participants list:
** Implementing the latest Doug's suggestions.
** Having trouble lazy loading HTML elements/templates in the Call Screen app. I am currently investigating the issue.
** It seems the issue magically disappear so I guess it was kind of a (already solved) regression.
** Asked Doug for a new revision. 
* Bug 1042484 - [dolphin][flame] wrong message was shown after the mo call was not received by another user.:
** Requested some info from the RIL guys.
** I will provide the RIL guys with the requested logs.
* Bug 1063032 - [Active Call] Visual Refinements for attention window:
** I started to familiarise with this bug.
** This is a bug Anthony was working on.
** I'll take it from the WIP we already provided by Anthony in the bug.


pacorampas (last updated October 8):

* Bug 977588 -  [Dialer] The Active call screen does not have the option to place calls on hold.
** I created this Bug 1069836 as follow up for fixing the localization

* Bug 1044996 - [Dialer][Call screen] New hit state for call screen options (mute, place new call, keypad...)
**  The patch works fine but in this bug is needed a feedback of   pabratowski@mozilla.com and/or kyee@mozilla.com. I don't know if we can   do anything for get the feedback early or what to do.
** <drs> I will get this actionable again, or at least clarify what they need. It looks like they don't want to make a decision on it yet.

* Bug 933596 - [Dialer] Unable to switch call waiting calls when dial pad is opened.
**  I have done a proposal for this bug. I think Carrie isn't happy with  my  proposal. But, there isn't another suggestion. I am waiting for a  NI  that I have asked to Rik
** <drs> I don't think we have to push this yet; we can wait for bug 977588 to land and then ask Carrie again if she hasn't responded by then. I think she's waiting to see what it looks like first.

* Bug 1060293 -  Remove dialer's buttons.css and use styling from shared/styles/buttons.css instead
** Waiting for gaia-button

* Bug 1079794 -        [Dialer] [Callscreen] When you are in active call and other call is entering you can't hold and answer with headset button
** I opened this bug


thills (last updated October 9)
* Bug 1024341 - Wakeup the device after call hangs up
** We split this into several bugs.  Right now, I'm working on one of the child bugs of this.
* Bug 1068109 to restore the 2s delay before the call screen goes away.  
** Need to ask for 2.1 approval.
** We also decided not to mark 1070066 resolved as there is another fix in the works for this.
* Bug 1068093  - Remove legacy transition code from the callscreen
** Started looking at this.  I have some working code.  I need to test this out on Tarako though as per bug 1075603
* Bug 1075603  - Explore removing contact background image waiting code from callscreen
** I'm having a few technical difficulties with my Tarako right now recognizing USB.  I sent an email to nhirata on this.
* Bug 1075699  -    Calling voicemail by long-pressing the 1 button displays an error and then calls.
** Submitted gaia patch for review.  
** Submitted gecko patch for review from Hsin-Yi.  She is fine with the changes and gave r+ in the bug comments since she's out tomorrow.  I have a try run in progress on this now.
* Bug 1066874  -    User can be put into a state where there is no one on the other line in a phone call and user is unable to end call
** I  spent pretty much all day on this one looking through logs and determined that this is an AT&T network issue based off the signaling.  Hsin-Yi confirmed this by looking through the logs.

//* Bug 1016885  - [Tarako][Dolphin][LMK][Youtube][USSD]  Pop-up USSD message causes  //Youtube being killed at background due to  LMK while using Youtube app
//**  The fix landed on master this morning, I'm working on the v1.3t patch  which should be //ready soon enough. This hasn't been nom'd for v1.4 but I  have the feeling it will.
//***  Rik: IMHO, when a bug is greenlit for a branch and has also landed on  master, it should //land on all branches up to the one it was greenlit  for. We've been bitten by 990003 because of //that. So yup, we should land  it on 1.4.
//**  (updated July 3rd) I landed a follow-up because of an issue on  multi-SIM devices I had //missed  in the original patch. I've got informal  approval from release  management to land on //1.4 so I'll land there too.  Totally agree on  landing on all branches starting with the older one  //that got approval  but hey, release management doesn't always seem to  agree :-(
//**   (updated July 4th) v1.3t patch is almost ready. It required some  significant changes and //even a fix for a bizarre race condition in the  LazyL10n code. I've asked for v1.4 approval for //the dependent bug and I  intend to land this one on v2.0 too.
//* Bug 990003 - [Dolphin][Tarako][Perf][Dialer] It takes a long time for the call screen shows up
//**  I had uplifted two dependencies and whipped together an almost working  uplift; Etienne //offered to help me out on that one to finish the  uplifts.
//** (Updated July 3rd) Etienne is taking care of the final uplifts
//* Bug 1002327 - We are trying to get imei by dialing the number *#06# on a device, which //has  two sim card slots, but only one imei returns
//** No work done yet, will be starting today
//** (Updated July 3rd) No progress here yet, too busy with the other bug
//** (Updated July 4th) Finally got my Flame build working, if I'm not too tired I'll try to fix this one //later today

//** Pending review from drs
//* Bug 1062749 - [Dialer] Make prettyDuration use l10n attributes instead of setting //textContent. Follow up bug 1061120
//**   <drs> If you have time after we land bug 1061120, you could work   on this. I know you have //other responsibilities, though.
