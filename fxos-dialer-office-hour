* New 2.2+ blocker
** https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1158727
* Spark priority
* <gsvelto> Doing l10n improvements for the Dialer.
* <drs> Introduce gsvelto and tedders1.

Mar 25
* <gsvelto> As a follow up to the v3 plans discussion of last week we should probably open a bug to mop up our CSS rules (in fact we might already have one). This goes hand in hand with re-thinking the way we lay out elements in the callscreen. The dialer is not in such a bad shape expect maybe for the call log; the callscreen is the biggest offender here IMHO.
* <gsvelto> A few thoughts about using the emulator for development: I've been extensively using the x86 emulator this week and while it can be useful for callscreen development it still has a few quirks. I wouldn't recommend it yet but if you need to test 5-way conference calls or other funky scenarios it's probably your best bet anyway.
* <drs> Pick bugs to punt to other Comms people.
** Bug 1146241 - [RTL][Dialer]The Arabic words of phone type is cut off in suggestion bar. <thills> I think this will be fixed by 1134961
** Bug 1142610 - [RTL] [Lockscreen] The carrier name overlaps the SIM slot text when recieiving a call on the lockscreen
** Bug 1146833 - [Flame][Dialer]During importing contacts, go back to contact A's call Information view, the screen will flash.
** Anymore incoming bugs until we stabilize our current workload.

Mar 17
* <thills> spend few minutes talking about updating review checklist for rtl.

*** http://logs.glob.uno/?c=mozilla%23gaia&s=18+Mar+2015&e=18+Mar+2015#c125900
* <gsvelto> discuss our plans for v3, here's a few ideas
** We know there will be an increased focus on making things modular so we could try turning some pieces of the dialer into proper web components (the keypad for example), or use some existing ones (overlays, buttons, etc...).
*** <jlorenzo> DTMF tones: Long pressing 1, then 2 without lifting 1, causes 2 to stop the tone for 1 and continue as 2 until either 1 or 2 are released. Pressing 3 at this point makes the 3 tone play, and then releasing either 1 or 3 causes the tone to stop.
** Startup performance is still high on the priority list and personally I haven't checked it in a while. We should consider it an area where we could imrpove things.
*** https://bugzil.la/1144537 — NEW, nobody@mozilla.org — When a contact changes try to update only the relevant call log entries
** We could decide to shed some tech baggage in the existing code. We don't know if the dialer will undergo a big redesign or not but even if it does being able to reuse more of the existing code would help. Most of the stuff we have now works fairly well but is too fragile to reuse.

Mar 4
* <thills> one item to discuss about CSS and localization.
** Practical that I know works: key={{str1}, key2={{str2}}, comma=, , |var format = str1 + comma + str2;|
** Most ideal: key={{str1}}, {{str2}} --> str1 and str2 are localized
*** <drs> AI: Investigate if this is possible or not.
* <gsvelto> Discuss remaining blockers 2.2+, how many do we have left?
** 5: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=1134961%2C1136664%2C1135044%2C1011066%2C1135063&list_id=12061381

*** All in https://wiki.mozilla.org/FirefoxOS/Comms/Dialer/SmokeTest. They can be fairly automated
*** The current 2 DSDS test cases:
**** https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/tests/python/gaia-ui-tests/gaiatest/tests/functional/dialer/test_dialer_dsds_make_phone_call_with_default_sim.py

*** Airplane mode https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/tests/python/gaia-ui-tests/gaiatest/tests/functional/dialer/test_dialer_airplane_mode.py
**** [jlorenzo] [AI] Not add this in dialer, ask the smoketest team if we could test that somewhere else.

* Tabless redesign
** https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17593665/Dialer-removing%20tabs%20-%20NEW.pdf
** From Carrie: "About the current proposal, we faced a problem that if we add a shortcut  to Contacts APP at the top, the transition to switch APPs is really  disturbing and also it makes users feel that tapping the "favorites"  (which are at the same area) will get them to contact details rather  than dial out directly (feedback received from user testing)."
** Why don't we just make the favorite contacts buttons do what the user expects, instead of redesigning the spec to include the contacts view?
** Prototype the contacts view as a view instead of iframe if we decide to keep that tab.
* Anything else?
* Little triage

Oct 29
* 2.2 feature proposal:
** VScroll
*** Sticky headers. May have to have a design where we have a button for loading more items.
*** No other app seems to use this for visual display. It seems that they use it for networking only, in particular within the Email app.
** Dialer/contacts split
*** We need to talk with Etienne about some history here. In particular, all the benefits.
** RTL compliance
** DataStore for call log
*** If 2.2 is a short release cycle, we will cut this.
* Little triage
** We canceled this due to the triage tomorrow.
* + anything else you want to talk about

Oct 22
 * <gtorodelvalle> Generation of sequence diagrams detailing the event and data flows for all the available calling scenarios:
   * It may help using a tool such as http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/ which I already used to get https://bug977056.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8508559 for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=977056 Source code for the diagram available at https://bug977056.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8508560
   * We are close to have the spec for event notification and data flow for the calling scenario when a participant leaves a conference call amongst 3 parties. It will solve https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1083402 and unblock https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=977588

 * Bug 977056 - [Dialer] Visual discrepancies: Call ended view under conference call participants list:
   * When a groupchanged event is notified to a call, I am not aware of any means to know if the notified call is still ongoing or maybe it was the hung up one causing the groupchange event since in this latest case I am also getting "connected" as the state of the call. According to this already existent code https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/apps/callscreen/js/handled_call.js#L86 I guess there was a time when we were getting at least "disconnecting" if not "disconnected" as the call state. Any clue?
