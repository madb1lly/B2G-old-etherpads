This pad is thought as a draft for Milestones in the B2G Tansition Project

As it seems hard to see the progress of this Project and its dependencies I suggest to slice the parts in to small milestones. 
Not to push anybody who adopted Apps or is Maintaining the Core but to get a overview of done and open work.
