SMS Daily Standup Meeting
Delete bugs you didn't work on, add new bugs
use "*"; not real lists
Add bug title (real one or approximate) so that we know what bug is about, but please don't add the link
Don't add things that are not SMS-related (indirectly related is fine).
Add things that can be interesting: problems you had and how you resolved them, things happening outside the team but that can affect us, etc.
Write what you did since the last standup, and what you'll do until the next standup

* Bug 1233552 - Intermittent TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | apps/sms/test/marionette/share_activity_test.js | Messages as share target Share via Messages Activity close button Should close activity if in NewMessage view
** Looks like finally the root cause in Gecko has been found by Kan-Run, Bobby and Boris - in "Bug 1244222 - Race when setting ToXPCOMCallback to a content function".
** So will close this bug this week if everything is fine.

* Bug 1244108 - [Messages][Tests] Fix and enable integration test for the Conversation-to-Participants path while in activity mode
** Prepared PR, got r+ and landed (landed).

* Bug 1222741 - [Messages] 'Delete thread' option is missing from the menu shown when viewing an SMS message
** Continued and stopped review because of the fact that PR has been constantly updated during review :) Will continue today (in progress).

Other:
* Digging into openHab and eclipse.org/smarthome to have better understanding of the abilities they provide.
