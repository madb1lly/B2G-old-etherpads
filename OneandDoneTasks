Tasks that Need Owners
Tasks in Italics are owned

Ownership entails:

    Keeping the task up to date

    Answering questions that come from users that perform the tasks

    Specifics regarding what it takes to "own" a task

    Periodically the feature may change as development continues - you must keep up to date with changes, and adjust the task accordingly
